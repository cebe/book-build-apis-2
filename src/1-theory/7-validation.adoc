= Validation

_Coming soon._

// If you as an API developer are lucky enough to have OpenAPI or JSON Schema
// contract files already written up, you can make the art of validation incredibly
// easy, and avoid writing a bunch of code to handle the validation rules, just by
// implementing an OpenAPI/JSON Schema validator in your controllers, or as
// middleware.

// GraphQL validation with Yup via graphql-shield
